Made the autocomplete better

* Autocomplete:
   * Now uses the Scryfall API instead of pre-downloaded JSON
   * Now should only have one autocomplete box shown at once if typing fast.

Pretty much just the basics.

* Uses Scryfall api to download JSON for specified card
* Simple autocomplete that uses pre-downloaded JSON file
* Option to display card image
