* Fixes
	* Add delay on API requests so Scryfall doesn't hate me (although I doubt they even notice me)
	* Fix images not flipping back when viewing normal card after viewing a flip card (i.e. Budoka Gardener)


* Additions
	* Add support for filtering out online only cards (e.g. maybe add a tick box next to border and images boxes to opt in to online cards)
	* Add getters and setters for all card properties for easy managing of all non "normal" cards (split, transform etc.)
