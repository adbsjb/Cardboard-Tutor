* Fixes
	* Add delay on API requests so Scryfall doesn't hate me (although I doubt they even notice me OwO)
	* Fix images not flipping back when viewing normal card after viewing a flip card (i.e. Budoka Gardener)


* Additions
	* Add getters and setters for all card properties for easy managing of all non "normal" cards (split, transform etc.)
